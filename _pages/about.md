Hi, my name is Tsedeniya Temesgen. I am a PhD Student at the Technical University of Munich. I am fortunate to have Prof. Dr. Alexander M. Fraser as my advisor to work on LLMs in Low-resource languages.

Before this, I held research roles at Apple and the Technical University of Denmark, working with Associate Professor Natalie Schluter, focusing on low-resource East African languages, particularly pretraining language models.

I earned my M.Sc. in Language Technology from Addis Ababa University, where Associate Prof. Martha Yifiru Tachbelie advised me.
My research interests lie in NLP for low-resource languages, especially African languages. I am particularly interested in investigating the behavior and limitations of LLMs for these languages, and how to support their effectiveness in low-resource settings amid the rapid advances in the LLM era. I also study how linguistic information can be effectively extracted and integrated into LLMs to better understand and enhance their usability in linguistically diverse and underrepresented settings.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss research, collaborate, or just talk about language tech in underrepresented settings!
