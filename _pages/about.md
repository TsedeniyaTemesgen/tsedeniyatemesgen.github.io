Hi, my name is Tsedenia Temesgen. I am a PhD Student at  [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/). I am fortunate to have [Prof. Dr. Alexander M. Fraser](https://alexfraser.github.io/) as my advisor to work on lingustic information in LLMs in Low resource languages. 

Prior to this, I’ve held research roles at Apple and Technical University of Denmark with  [Associate Professor Natalie Schluter](https://natschluter.github.io/), focusing on low-resource East African language particulary focusing on pretraining langauge models.

I earned my M.Sc. in Information Science and Systems (Language Technology) from [Addis Ababa University(https://aau.edu.et/)], where I was advised by A[ssociate Prof. Martha Yifiru Tachbelie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martha-yifiru-tachbelie-73099b1b/?originalSubdomain=et). During my master’s, I worked on grammar checking for Amharic language.

My research interests lie in natural language processing (NLP) for low-resource languages, especially African languages. I am particularly interested in investigating the behavior and limitations of large language models (LLMs) for these languages in the context of the evolving LLM era. I also study how linguistic information can be effectively extracted and integrated into LLMs to better understand and enhance their usability in linguistically diverse and underrepresented settings.

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss research, collaborate, or just talk about language tech in underrepresented settings!
