I'm a PhD student at Technical University of Munich. (.....)
I was an assistant researcher with hands-on experience in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially focusing on low-resource African languages. Iâ€™ve worked with Apple and the Technical University of Denmark on projects ranging from evaluating pre-training data quality and dataset usability, to studying the effectiveness of embeddings and LLMs for linguistically underrepresented communities. My academic background includes an MSc in Information Science and Systems with a specialization in Language Technology, and prior teaching experience as a lecturer in programming, AI, and data systems. I'm passionate about bridging linguistic gaps in AI and building inclusive language technologies.
